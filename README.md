On macOS, pip is typically included with recent versions of Python. To install or verify it, you can use the command python3 -m pip --version to check the installed version or python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip to upgrade it. If you haven't already, you can install Python using Homebrew by running /bin/bash -c “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)” followed by brew install python. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Verify Python Installation and PIP:
Open Terminal and run python3 --version to see if Python 3 is installed.
If Python 3 is installed, run python3 -m pip --version to check if PIP is installed. 
2. Install Python (if needed):
If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can use Homebrew to install it. First, install Homebrew if you don't have it: /bin/bash -c “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)”.
Then, install Python using brew install python.
After installation, PIP should be included with Python. 
3. Install or Update PIP: 
If PIP isn't installed or you want to update it, you can use python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip. 
4. Verify PIP Installation:
After the update, run python3 -m pip --version to confirm the installed version. 
5. Using PIP:
Once installed, you can use PIP to install, update, and manage Python packages. 
For example, to install a package, use python3 -m pip install package_name.
